I focused on the sentiment of Japanese citizens toward foreign countries and then obtained [csv data
](https://survey.gov-online.go.jp/r04/r04-gaiko/) from [the Cabinet Office of Japan](https://www.cao.go.jp/index-e.html), which has been conducting foreign policy opinion polls for over 40 years.

I analyzed changes in responses to the question of whether people feel familiarity with each of the four countries surrounding Japan: the U.S., China, South Korea, and Russia. I also looked at generational and gender differences in the most recent survey results.
In the most recent survey, familiarity with South Korea increased, while that with Russia dropped. I see political relations as having had an impact. Also, younger people feel more familiarity with China and South Korea. The percentage of women who feel close to South Korea is higher than that of men. From this we can infer the influence of economic and cultural relations.

I looked at the trends with a simple analysis by using Pandas , created some charts by using  Data Wrapper and constructed the pages by using visual studio code. These were new to me.

## Things I would've liked to do:
I would have liked to examine the relationship with other data such as economic indicators and the popularity of cultural content, but I could not go that far.
